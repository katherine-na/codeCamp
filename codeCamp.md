## Comments in JavaScript:

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:

```
// This is an in-line comment

```

You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /_ and ending with _/. This is a multi-line comment:

```
/* This is a
multi-line comment */
```

## Declare JavaScript Variables

JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

```
var ourName;
```
